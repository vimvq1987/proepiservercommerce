Coming from a long history even before the acquisition, Commerce Manager can be considered as the legacy part of Episerver Commerce. It might not
have the shiny, responsive design with widgets like the new Catalog UI, but it does it job quite well. Some of its users even liked it, for it 
efficiency. Truth be told, Commerce Manager will not be actively developed. Bugs will be fixed, but no new features will be added. With the dawn of 
ASP.NET core (Formerly ASP.NET 5), which does not support WebForms, the forseen future of Commerce Manager will be relied on life-support, and eventually
phrased out. It has had it days.

But that will not happen anytime soon. Commerce Manager will continue to run, maybe silently in hundreds of implementations of Episerver Commerce.
It's not dead website. And its architecture, which might be confused at first, allow you to extend the functionalities when you need. It might not
be the most customizable framework out there, but it does it job.

Let's us look in a specific case as I get from a question in Episerver World forums: How to add the wish-list feature to the Order management system
of Commerce Manager.
