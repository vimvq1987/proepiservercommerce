# Pro Episerver Commerce development
This is a book about Episerver Commerce development. Episerver Commerce (Formerly known as EPiServer Commerce) is an e-Commerce platform built on .NET, which provide powerful and conprehensive features for building e-Commerce solution. But it's still a long way to make it works: How to harness the power, how to workaround the weaknesses, how to adapt to real-world requirements. This book attempts to be a definitive guide for developers who want to master Episerver Commerce to build world-class e-Commerce solution.

This is a work-in-progress. I'll try to update it as frequent as I can, but writing a book, especially a book about a big, complicated framework is no easy task. Your contributions are warmly welcome.

## Who is this book for
I will not try to make this a cook book (although I'll cover some detail implementations when I think they are needed). If you want to be up to speed, I would recommend taking one of Episerver Commerce courses (http://www.episerver.com/Training/) - there are some of very good trainers there. This book aims to be an view from inside Commerce, how things work, how can it be more efficient,etc. Some experience with C#/SQL Server are needed. Experience with Episerver CMS or Commerce is a big plus, but not required.  If you like in-depth books, this is for you.

## Thanks.
I would like to thank:
My team at Episerver, for the help and support, and good laughs.

My boss Magnus Str√•le, for the inspiration and encouragement.

My wife Huong, for taking care of everything else.
